### 😎 Hi there, I'm Erik Vanderlei Fernandes

I have been in the technology area since 2010, always looking to help businesses in the best use of their resources. In order to help my clients and partners I seek to study several areas ... seriously, several ... From systems development, marketing, audiovisual, to car mechanics.

Each new discipline I learn, I always try to bring and apply in my day to day, my business, and for my clients.

Today I am a partner at Adalov, a company where our goal is to “Solve the customer's problem”. That's why I'm always looking to update myself, and look at other points of view outside of technology. So that I can solve the customer's problem!
